A gourmet selection of things from my ~/bin

- *manifest* - pretty print the OSGi bundle manifest of a specified JAR
- *jarfind* - recursively search the JARs in a directory (defaults to Maven local repo) for classes whose names match a given regular expression
- *mergeinfo* - recursively descend from working directory, printing out the names of files and directories which have svn:mergeinfo properties. Useful for removing unwanted subtree merge info from SVN repositories when you can't migrate to git
